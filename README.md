This is the PalorderSMP Mod its open source and be free to contact me if you want me to add features but not intense one's By the way if you're a skid are someone who wants the jar file for this mod well you need to trade so let gradle eat all your performance and after that it will poop it out ok enough jokes lets get to the real stuff
## How to build the project

## Step One
Clone this repo and look for gradlew.bat BUT replace the contents from gradle.properties from this:" # Sets default memory used for gradle commands. Can be overridden by user or command line properties.
and replace it with this: "# Sets default memory used for gradle commands. Can be overridden by user or command line properties.
# This is required to provide enough memory for the Minecraft decompilation process and replace the inside of gradle.properties with the lines that are Below
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4g -Xms4g -Xss2m
org.gradle.daemon=false"
## Step Two

Run gradlew.bat file And wait for it on the lowest line saying "Build Completed Or succesfully Executed Build or Successfully generated Build"

## How to get the Mod file (".jar")

After Run gradlew.bat task is completed look in the project root directory and look for the generated build folder and look for a libs folder inside of build folder and there inside will be a functional .jar file that u can put in your forge 1.18.2 mod loader
